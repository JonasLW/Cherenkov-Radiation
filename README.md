# Cherenkov-Radiation

The purpose of this repository is to plot quantities related to Cherenkov radiation.  
The code is spread over four files, two for functions and two for scripting.  

Plotting.py      - Utility functions for the purpose of efficient plotting,    
Functions.py     - Functions related to the physics of Cherenkov radiation,  
Integration.py   - Script for plotting quantities which involve integration,  
NoIntegration.py - Script for plotting quantities which do not involve integration
